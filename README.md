# TaskForce

My TaskForce repository consists of four main folders: "Challenges," "Images," "gallery01," and "gallery03."
## Challenges
Challenges: This folder contains all the necessary files for the JavaScript challenges. Specifically, it includes two JavaScript files: "arrayMap.js" and "stringTransform.js." These files contain code for solving challenges related to arrays and strings. To run these files, you need to have Node.js installed, which is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. Change your directory to the "Challenges" folder and type node filename, replacing "filename" with the name of the file you want to run (e.g., node arrayMap.js).


## Image
This folder contains all the images used in the HTML and CSS files. These images are integrated into the gallery layout by default.
## gallery01
This folder includes a gallery with a desktop-only view.
## gallery03
 This folder contains a responsive version of the gallery01. It is designed to work on devices with a maximum width of 400px, meaning you need to open it on a phone with a screen width of 400px or less.

When interacting with the gallery, clicking on the "know-more" link displays only the associated image in detail. Clicking the close button returns you to the original gallery layout, displaying all images as they were initially.
